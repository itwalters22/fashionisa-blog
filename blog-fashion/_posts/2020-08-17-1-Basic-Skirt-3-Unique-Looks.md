Black denim skirts are a staple I keep in my wardrobe year-round, but with only a few warm months left in 2020, I’ve decided to feature some ways I style these skirts in late summer/early fall. So, without further ado, here are 3 unique looks that I love to wear this time of year:

<p class="lst-item">1. The Bold</p>

I am a huge fan of this look because it requires minimal effort to put together. All I did was put on an oversized graphic t-shirt and tie it in the back. I purposefully chose a shirt with a bold logo/print on it because I wanted it to be the statement piece of my outfit. I’m actually wearing my dad’s shirt because I think the juxtaposition the large sleeves and the tight skirt makes my outfit especially stylish. To really pull together this look, I paired some gold geometric earrings from Francesca’s with a snake print belt from Goodwill. As a final touch, I added my favorite sunglasses to create a chill ~cool girl~ vibe. If you’re looking for some trendy shades, I suggest hitting up your local thrift store because they usually have a large selection.

<p class="lst-item">2. Floral</p>

This is honestly one of my favorite outfits to wear in the summertime. I think this black floral shirt from Buffalo Exchange goes particularly well with the black skirt, although any color floral top would look fabulous; black is a super versatile color. The yellow floral earrings I’m wearing (from Francesca’s) add a splash of color, which creates a very polished look. A rule of thumb I tend to follow is that if I’m wearing all black/white I’ll accessorize with bold and/or colorful jewelry.

<p class="lst-item">3. Vintage Vibes</p>

I absolutely love this look because it reminds me of my favorite season: autumn. In fact, I will be wearing this look well into the fall by pairing it with some tights and a cute jacket. Another reason I love this outfit is because the tie top looks vintage, even though it’s actually just from Goodwill. The headband I’m wearing here was a hand-me-down from my mother, but you can purchase a similar one pretty much anywhere. While I chose to pair the other outfits in this post with flip-flops or sandals (not pictured), I decided to complete this look with espadrilles that matched the color of my top.

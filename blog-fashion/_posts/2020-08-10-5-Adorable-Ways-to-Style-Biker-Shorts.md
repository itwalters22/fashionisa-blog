One of the biggest fashion trends of summer 2020 is biker shorts. Whether you're going for a casual or a more put together look, I guarantee that you can style these shorts into a cute outfit. If you want to rock this trend, look no further than this post for some inspiration.

<p class="lst-item">1. The Sporty Look</p>

This look is great for chilling in your house or for running errands. It’s also super convenient because it doubles as an outfit to work out in. Pairing a crop top with biker shorts is pretty basic, but if you add some cool jewelry you'll definitely stand out more. I picked silver and black jewelry to go with this outfit since it fits with the grey color scheme. Fun fact about the necklace: it’s actually an essential oil necklace that you can unscrew and rub the essential oil on your wrists and neck. It’s great for stress relief!

The earrings I'm wearing in this look are Kenneth Cole Reaction, and the essential oils necklace was my mother’s from when she lived in NYC, but you can find similar ones on Etsy.

And that’s the tea on how to stay cute, comfy, and chill during quarantine!

<p class="lst-item">2. The Luxury Look</p>

Are you someone who is on a serious budget but still wants to look like you dropped a lot of money an outfit? If so, this look is for you. All you need to do is pair your biker shorts with a cute tube top. Personally I prefer black because it makes my gold jewelry stand out more, but definitely don't be afraid to try out a bold patterned or colored tube top. The gold statement necklace and earrings I'm wearing weren’t even expensive, but they certainly make my outfit appear luxurious. The key is to go to stores that sell inexpensive jewelry and purchase items that look like they're made from actual gold (i.e. shiny, polished, don’t chip easily) even though they probably aren’t.

<p class="lst-item">3. The Busy College Student Look</p>

You'll definitely see me wearing this outfit during the school week when I go back to college. My favorite thing about this look is that you can make it super casual by wearing tennis shoes or you can dress it up with some heels. In the picture I’m wearing special tennis shoes that my doctor told me to wear for my arch problems, but I think that white tennis shoes would look even better with this outfit. I also love this look because you can tie the denim jacket around your waist during the day and then wear it when it gets colder at night, which is perfect if you go to school up north.

<p class="lst-item">4. The Casual Look</p>

This is probably the most ubiquitous way of styling biker shorts, but hey, it works! If you want a casual, effortless look, just pair your biker shorts with an oversized shirt/hoodie. The long sleeved shirt I’m wearing is actually my dad’s from when he performed with the Joffrey Ballet, so unfortunately I don’t think it is sold anywhere. Any oversized shirt with a cool graphic will do for this look, though! I went for silver and black earrings for this look because I’m wearing black and white, but if I had chosen a more colorful t-shirt I would have added gold jewelry.

<p class="lst-item">5. The Fancy Look</p>

I am actually really in love with this look because it makes me look fancy even though I'm literally wearing gym shorts. I’d say this is a good outfit for if you don’t have a lot of time to change before a night out. Let's say you’ve been wearing outfit #2 all day, but need to quickly get ready for dinner. All you have to do is add a white cardigan and a purse and you're good to go. Also, if you don’t like the biker shorts with this outfit, you can just throw on a black skirt and you’ll look stunning.

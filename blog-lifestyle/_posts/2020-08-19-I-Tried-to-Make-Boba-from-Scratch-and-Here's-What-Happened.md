One of my life goals is to learn and try as many new things as I can. I figure, maybe if I add posts about what I want to learn and try in life, I will accomplish these things. That being said, this post will be the first of a brand new series on my blog called “Isa Tries It” where I try new things and post about how they went!

Currently, I’m trying to master the art of making boba. Since I’ve made regular boba from scratch before, I figured why not spice things up this time and add a fruity flavor. Instead of following a recipe though, I decided to experiment on my own.

First I gathered my ingredients: fruit (I chose blueberries for blueberry flavored boba), brown sugar, tapioca flour, and water.

Next, I crushed up the blueberries using the back of a spoon and strained them into a glass of boiling water, creating a juice. I accidentally put too much water into the mix, which diluted the flavor. When I make flavored boba again, I’m going to start with hardly any water to make sure there’s an even stronger blueberry taste.

Once I finished crushing the blueberries, I heated the juice up in the microwave so that it was very hot. Then came the hardest part of making boba: creating the dough. I put about 9 tablespoons of tapioca flour in a bowl and poured in the juice little by little, stirring constantly. At first, the dough was a bit too crumbly, so I added more juice. Unfortunately, this made the dough too sticky/putty-like. It took me a while, but I finally added just enough flour to the mix to create a playdough-like consistency, and then molded the dough into a ball.

I began to roll the dough into strips and sliced it up. Then, I rolled those slices into tiny spheres, keeping in mind that the boba would expand when I cooked it.

While the boba balls were sitting out, I started boiling some water on medium heat and added brown sugar to it. I put a lot of sugar into the mixture, but there was still way too much water for it to become the ideal brown sugar syrup. I added the boba and set a timer for 15 minutes. To give the boba even more blueberry flavor, I dumped the juice I had left over into the boiling pot. But again, this was too much liquid, so my boba coating was super watery and not very sweet. I plan to use a lot less water the next time around.

When 15 minutes was up, I poured the boba and syrup mixture from the pan into a bowl. I let the boba and syrup cool for a couple of minutes before putting some in the serving glasses. I then swished around the syrup to coat the insides of the glass.

Finally, I brewed my teas (one Numi Jasmine Green Tea and one Whole Foods 365 Organic Black Tea). I made sure to use 2 tea bags instead of 1 for extra flavor.

I added ice to my serving glasses, poured the hot tea over it and topped that off with some milk. I definitely added too much milk this time around, so it was hard to taste the tea flavors. Oh well, you live and you learn. Next time, I’m definitely going to use more tea and less milk.

And here’s the highly anticipated final result:

Surprisingly, the boba really did have a yummy blueberry flavor, and a pretty pink color! For my first go at flavored boba tea with no recipe, I’m pretty happy with the results, and I’m really excited to try this process again with a couple adjustments. If you guys try this at home, I would absolutely love to see your creations, so feel free to post pictures and tag my instagram/tiktok @fashionisa.blog or use the hashtag #fashionisablog so I can see it! :)
